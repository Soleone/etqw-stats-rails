== ETQW Stats

This is a web application, useful for players of Enemy Territory - Quake Wars.
You can register with your account-name and download statistics of your play style (XP, kills, etc).

Because the database stores different statistics for their corresponding date, you can compare 
different sessions you played, and see for example how many XP in what Class you gained yesterday from 10:00 to 12:00.
